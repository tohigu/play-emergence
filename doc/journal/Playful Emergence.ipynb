    "\n",
    "Via Soler-Adillon, we learn that some game theorists have referred to  Holland's definition of emergence as a concept to explore the idea of open vs. closed games (Juul, 2002; Salen and Zimmerman, 2004; Adams and Dormans 2012).\n",
    "The authors consider emergence as a characteristic of a game in which the progression isn't predefined. Instead, these games offer a set of rules that lead to unpredictable results and, in consequence, producing novelty as an emergent feature.\n",
    "However, Soler-Adillon points out that Holland's original concern about emergence is, in reality, referring to the capacity for self-organization of a system.\n",
    "Considering those above, I believe it should be worthy to examine emergence in this context as the expression of self-organization. With the purpose of being more specific, instead of aiming to create a system that just outputs unpredictable behavior based on a set of rules, I will try to design a system that based on its previous learning creates new actions through self-organization.\n",
    "Along those lines, before proceeding, it will be necessary to revise the ideas presented by these authors."
